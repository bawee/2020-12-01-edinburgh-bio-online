# EMAIL TO SEND OUT TO ATTENDEES ON SUNDAY 29th NOVEMBER

Hi,

You are a registered participant on our Data Carpentry Workshop spread over the next 3 weeks (1-15 December). This email lists the key things you'll need for joining the workshop and will help you set up your computer for it. There is a lot of information here, so please read everything carefully!  

**We have marked things requiring particular attention with (!!!) below, notably the pre-workshop survey.**

Please also note that all times advertised here are UK time, currently GMT.

## 1. What the workshop is about

This is an introductory workshop to analysis and visualization of tabular data using R, for biologists.
It is designed to be suitable for beginners to R and to command-line programming.
We will use a mixture of biological data including genomics examples.
The material starts with basics of data organization, moves through introductions to R and the RStudio environment and R basics. 
The second week, we will cover aggregating and analysing data, then data visualization with ggplot2.
The third week will be a single "Data Surgery" session, where you can bring your own data to discuss and work with, using tools taught in the course.
Full schedule is here: https://edcarp.github.io/2020-12-01-edinburgh-bio-online/.

A key learning goal is that nice analysis and visualization is made possible by structuring the data nicely in the first place.
If you're interested in the ideas behind "tidy data" and want some background reading, we recommend [Tidy Data, by Hadley Wickham](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10).
A more extended recent paper on the same topic is [Data Organization in Spreadsheets, by Karl W. Broman and Kara H. Woo](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989).

## 2. Please let us know if you cannot join

We have a waiting list for the workshop and it would be great to give someone else the chance to join. If you can't attend, please cancel your booking and send us an email so that we can offer your place to someone else.

## 3. Installing Zoom (!!!)

The workshop will use the Zoom video-conferencing system.

You may have already installed Zoom for your University work. If you haven't yet installed Zoom, please install it from: https://zoom.us/download. Please make sure that you have Zoom version 5.0 or better.

## 4. Joining details for the workshop

Zoom Meeting Link:
https://ed-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/88226821952

We will send the password in a separate email.

You'll be able to join the workshop from 13:45 (1.45pm) on Tuesday, 1st December. We aim to use the same link for all sessions as a "recurring meeting", and will email again if that changes.

## 5. Installing necessary software (!!!)

You may need to install some software for the workshop. Please make sure you do this before the workshop starts. Full details and instructions are on the workshop page: 
https://edcarp.github.io/2020-12-01-edinburgh-bio-online/

Here's a quick summary of the key things you'll need:
* An up-to-date web browser.
* For the Spreadsheets (Tuesday 1st) lesson: You will need access to a spreadsheet program such as LibreOffice, Google Sheets, or Microsoft Excel.
* For the R (all other) lessons: We'll be using the University of Edinburgh's Noteable service, which just requires you to have a browser and uses the EASE login system. 
* **Backup plan for the R lessons**: We strongly recommend you install R and Rstudio on your local computer, just in case the Noteable service goes down during the workshops. Also, then you will have R and RStudio installed on your local computer ready to use. There are instructions here: https://datacarpentry.org/ecology-workshop/setup-r-workshop.html.

If you have any trouble, send us an email or ask during the setup session (see below). We'll also be available in the Zoom meeting from 13:45am on Tuesday, should you have any last-minute software issues.

## 6. Preparing your workspace for the workshop

You will find that having more than one screen will help you follow the course. If you can display the Zoom session on an external monitor and type on your laptop/desktop then you will get the most benefit (use an extended desktop - not mirrored displays). If you have the right connections you could use your TV as an external monitor or if you have a network-enabled tablet you could connect to Zoom using this and do your typing on your laptop. If you have more than one device available you can connect to Zoom on one and use the second one to perform the task. If you only have one display then the optimal configuration will be to use half of your screen for the Zoom window and the other half for your application. You will find that your screen real estate will be precious. Please, be vocal if you are having problems and we shall try to help where we can.

## 7. Best practices using Zoom

* Rename yourself with your full name (→ Click "Participants" tab, find your name and click on the rename button).
* Share your video, if possible (it is easier to teach when instructors can see people's faces).
* Mute yourself when you are not speaking (mute button in the toolbar at the bottom).
* Use Zoom nonverbal feedback indicators (→ Click "Participants" tab) to raise hands, give feedback, or ask for help.

You will get more info on this during the introduction.
