# Data Surgery Session 15th December 14:00-17:00

The last session of this workshop will be a "data surgery" session, 
where learners bring their own scientific data, and work with helpers and 
instructors to address those *using tools learned in the course*.
This is designed to reinforce the skills learned in the sessions so far,
and to provide practical help in applying them in your research.

This session is experimental for us. 
We are setting some ground rules and preparation instructions,
to make sure that it goes smoothly.

In the course, we covered working with tabular data in R:

- principles of tidy data, and organization in spreadsheets
- introduction to R and RStudio
- R basics - factors and data frames
- aggregating and analyzing data with dplyr
- plotting data with ggplot2.

So, we will restrict the data surgery to these topics, which are already broad!

It's helpful if the data you bring address a clear goal. Examples include:

- This instrument gives me data in a weird text format, and I want to tidy it up for analysis
- I want to compare this list of gene hits with this other table of data
- I have a list of peptide hits from my proteomics screen, and I want to restrict to those on a small list of interesting proteins or that have some other feature
- I've read this paper that plots results for a few genes, and I'd like to use supplementary table 3 to plot the results for my favourite gene
- I've plotted a growth curve in Excel and I'd like to plot it in R
- I want to plot the distribution of this data as a histogram or density plot, and find out if it differes between replicates.
- and so on...

It's fine to bring a "practice problem" - a data set and challenge that is similar to your longer-term goal, but smaller and/or easier. 

Please write in the [collaborative document](https://pad.carpentries.org/2020-12-01-edinburgh-bio-online),
by 10:00 on the day of the workshop to give instructors time to prepare.

- Name. My science goal is...  My data or plotting goal is... 

We look forward to seeing you on Tuesday. Please ask us questions on the collaborative document, or by email!
